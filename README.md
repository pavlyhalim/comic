# “Day in the Life of a Stickman at NYUAD”

#Description:

The website hosts a short comic titled “Day in the Life of a Stickman at NYUAD”. It basically takes the user through the normal life of a student at NYUAD. The comic starts with our person sleeping, he wakes up, gets dressed up for the day and then the user interactivity comes into play. In each panel the user gets two choices, and based on the choice the user selects the panel changes. The panel shifts based on the user’s choice and the user basically gets to control how the stickman will spend his day, and after the last panel we go back to our first panel. In order to keep the user engrossed by the comic, we wanted to keep the user a central part of the comic and hence we came up with the idea that instead of it just being a simple day in the life of a student at NYUAD, we gave the user the power to influence how the day goes by.  

# Process:

We used pictures from the internet and then edited them using photoshop in order to give the pictures a “comicy” effect, so we integrated that within our comic. And also another thing we experimented with was how we wanted our comic to keep both the real worldly and comic worldly feel within it. Some of the tools we made use of during this project were Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for the purpose of editing the images. And as far as our coding is concerned we used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.    				


# Evaluation:

Initially we wanted to make a simple comic that was based on the day of the life of our group member Pavly, but during the stage of brainstorming we realized that we wanted to keep the user a part of the comic too and so we decided to incorporate the idea of providing in each panel two choices that would affect how the day went by. We wanted our comic to stay true to a comic in terms of graphics and I think we were quite successful in achieving that. We were able to get the user interactivity that we had wanted from the beginning, so I think overall we managed to successfully create the comic just the way we had imagined it to be.
